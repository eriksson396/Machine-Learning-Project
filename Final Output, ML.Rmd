# Data  {-}
First of all, I present all relevant data sources and explain essential features to get a
proper overview. Afterwards, I explain the process of loading the data into R and how
we process the raw text corpus, to obtain meaningful results.

## Data Sources

For our empirical analysis we use three main data sources. The Ô¨Årst two data sources are
used for the text analysis and the building of the subgroups. Data on the speeches of
the UNSC were obtained from @schonfeld2019. It contains 82165 speeches over
the years 1995 until 2017.
